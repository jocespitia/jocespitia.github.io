# Jocelyn Espitia's Personal Website

~ A site to keep track of all my doings ðŸ’–~

I am a senior computer science student at California State University, Long Beach. My future career plans after graduating are within software engineering roles. An ideal role would be as a front-end or web dev, but I am open to any others such as full-stack or back-end!

## Future Updates:
* I plan on adding more animations and a splash page!
